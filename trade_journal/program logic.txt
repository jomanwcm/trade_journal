# Trade Journal Program

This is a **Python-based trade journal application** built with Tkinter and `tksheet`.  
It is designed to help traders quickly record price action arguments (bull, bear, trading range, bias) for each bar in a trading session.

## Features

- **Interactive Button Panel**
  - Buttons are grouped into categories:
    - 牛方論點 (Bull arguments)
    - 熊方論點 (Bear arguments)
    - TR論點 (Trading Range arguments)
    - BIAS (Bias arguments)
  - When a user selects a cell in the journal table and presses a button, the button text is inserted into the selected cell.

- **Journal Table (tksheet)**
  - Displays rows of bars for the session.
  - Each row has columns for bull, bear, trading range, and bias notes.
  - Supports editing, resizing, and selection.
  - Content can be autosaved and reloaded.

- **Autosave**
  - Changes made in the sheet are automatically saved and reloaded when the app is restarted.

- **Tooltips**
  - Hover over buttons to see their full description.
